--- TASK DESCRIPTION ---

We want a function that receives a color in hex-format - like #c0ffee - and returns an object with the r, g, and b values (numbers) - in this case: {r:192, g:255, b:238}.

The function must receive a single string, that will always start with a # symbol, followed by six hex-digits.

The function must create three variables, r, g, and b - set their values correctly, and return them in a single object.

Modify your existing hexToRGB function, so it doesn't console.log anything, but returns an object.

Test it from the console, and make sure you still get the correct r, g and b values.
